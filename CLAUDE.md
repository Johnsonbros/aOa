# aOa - 5 Angles. 1 Attack.

**CRITICAL: This project has aOa installed. ALWAYS use `aoa grep` instead of Grep/Glob.**

---

## Confidence & Communication

### Traffic Light System

Always indicate confidence level before starting work:

| Signal | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 🟢 | Confident | Proceed freely |
| 🟡 | Uncertain | Try once. If it fails, research via Context7 or ask if architectural |
| 🔴 | Lost | STOP immediately. Summarize and ask: "Should we use 131?" |

### Set Expectations

Don't go too far without telling the user:
- What you're about to do
- Where to follow along (BOARD.md, logs, etc.)
- Your confidence level (traffic light)

### 1-3-1 Approach (For Getting Unstuck)

When hitting 🔴 or repeated 🟡 failures:

1. **1 Problem** - State ONE simple problem (not composite)
2. **3 Solutions** - Research three professional production-grade solutions
3. **1 Recommendation** - Give one recommendation (single solution, blend, or hybrid)

This breaks death spirals and forces clear thinking.

## Agent Conventions

When the user addresses an agent by name using "Hey [AgentName]", spawn that agent to handle the request.

| Trigger | Agent | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| "Hey Beacon" | beacon | Project continuity - work board, progress tracking, session handoffs |
| "Hey 131" | 131 | Research-only problem solving with parallel solution discovery |
| "Hey GH" | gh | Growth Hacker - solutions architect, problem decomposer |

### aOa-Aware Agents (IMPORTANT)

**When spawning subagents for codebase exploration, use aOa agents instead of built-in Explore:**

| Use This | Instead Of | Why |
|----------|------------|-----|
| `aoa-scout` | Explore (quick) | Uses `aoa grep`, 10-50x faster |
| `aoa-explore` | Explore (thorough) | Uses `aoa grep`, saves tokens |

**Built-in Explore agents don't use aOa** - they fall back to slow Grep/Glob.

Example - spawning parallel searches:
```
Task(subagent_type="aoa-scout", prompt="Find authentication handlers")
Task(subagent_type="aoa-scout", prompt="Find database models")
```

### Agent Context Loading

**All agents MUST read context files before exploring the codebase.**

When spawning any agent, instruct it to first read:
1. `.context/BOARD.md` - Current focus, active tasks, blockers
2. `.context/CURRENT.md` - Session context, recent decisions

## Rule #1: Symbol Angle First

**NEVER do this:**
```bash
# WRONG - Multiple tool calls, slow, wasteful
Grep(pattern="auth", path="src/")  # 1 call
Read(file1.py)                      # 2 calls
Read(file2.py)                      # 3 calls
Read(file3.py)                      # 4 calls
# = 4 tool calls, ~8,500 tokens, 2+ seconds
```

**ALWAYS do this:**
```bash
# RIGHT - One call, fast, efficient
aoa grep auth
# Returns: file:line for ALL matches in <5ms
# Then read ONLY the specific lines you need
```

## Rule #2: aOa Returns File:Line - Use It

aOa grep output:
```
⚡ 20 hits │ 4.73ms
  index/indexer.py:1308
  status_service.py:56
  status_service.py:115
```

This tells you EXACTLY where to look. Don't read entire files - read specific line ranges:
```bash
Read(file_path="src/index/indexer.py", offset=1305, limit=10)
```

## Rule #3: One Angle Replaces Many Tools

**WRONG:**
```bash
Grep("auth")    # call 1
Grep("login")   # call 2
Grep("session") # call 3
```

**RIGHT:**
```bash
aoa grep "auth login session"  # ONE call, ranked results
```

## Rule #4: Three Search Modes

**Symbol Lookup (O(1) - instant, full index):**
```bash
aoa grep tree_sitter                  # exact symbol
aoa grep "auth session token"         # multi-term OR search, ranked
```
**Note:** Space-separated terms are OR search, not phrase search.

**Multi-Term Intersection (full index):**
```bash
aoa grep -a auth,session,token        # files containing ALL terms (AND)
```

**Pattern Search (regex - working set only ~30-50 files):**
```bash
aoa egrep "tree.sitter"               # regex
aoa egrep "def\\s+handle\\w+"         # find patterns
```
**Warning:** Pattern search only scans local/recent files, not full codebase.

**When to use which:**
- `aoa grep` → Know the symbol, need speed, OR logic
- `aoa grep -a` → Need files matching ALL terms (AND logic)
- `aoa egrep` → Need regex matching (working set only)

**Tokenization:** Hyphens and dots break tokens (`app.post` → `app`, `post`).

## Commands

| Command | Use For | Speed |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `aoa grep <term>` | Symbol lookup | <5ms |
| `aoa grep "term1 term2"` | Multi-term OR search | <10ms |
| `aoa grep -a t1,t2` | Multi-term AND search | <10ms |
| `aoa egrep "regex"` | Regex search | ~20ms |
| `aoa find "*.py"` | File discovery | <10ms |
| `aoa locate name` | Fast filename search | <5ms |
| `aoa tree [dir]` | Directory structure | <50ms |
| `aoa hot` | Frequently accessed files | <10ms |
| `aoa health` | Check services | instant |
| `aoa intent recent` | See what's being worked on | <50ms |

## API Endpoints (localhost:8080)

For programmatic access via curl:

```bash
curl "localhost:8080/symbol?q=handleAuth"           # Symbol search
curl "localhost:8080/multi?q=auth+login+handler"    # Multi-term ranked
curl "localhost:8080/files"                          # List indexed files
curl "localhost:8080/intent/recent"                  # Recent intents
```

## Efficiency Comparison

| Approach | Tool Calls | Tokens | Time |
|----------|------------|--------|------|
| Grep + Read loops | 7 | 8,500 | 2.6s |
| aOa grep | 1-2 | 1,150 | 54ms |
| **Savings** | **71%** | **86%** | **98%** |

## Decision Tree

1. **Need to find code?** → `aoa grep <term>` (NOT Grep)
2. **Need multiple terms?** → `aoa grep "term1 term2"` (NOT multiple Greps)
3. **Need files by pattern?** → `aoa find "*.py"` or `aoa locate name`
4. **Need file content?** → Read specific lines from aOa results (NOT entire files)
5. **Need regex matching?** → `aoa egrep "pattern"`
6. **Need to understand patterns?** → `aoa intent recent`

## Intent Tracking

Every tool call is captured automatically. The status line shows:
```
⚡ aOa │ 61 intents │ 14 tags │ 0.1ms │ searching shell markdown editing
```

This helps predict which files you'll need next.

├── BOARD.md        # Master table - all work with status, deps, solution patterns
├── COMPLETED.md    # Archive of completed work with session history
├── BACKLOG.md      # Parked items with enough detail to pick up later
├── decisions/      # Architecture decision records (ADRs)

```

## Docker Parity Rule

**CRITICAL: Both Docker approaches MUST be maintained in parity.**

We provide two deployment options:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Multi-container (gateway, index, status, proxy, redis) - better for debugging
- `Dockerfile` - Monolithic single container - simpler for end users

**When modifying services:**
1. Update the service code (e.g., `services/status/status_service.py`)
2. Verify change works in docker-compose: `docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d`
3. Verify change works in monolithic: `docker build -t aoa . && docker run ...`
4. Both must produce identical behavior

**Environment variables must match** - if you add an env var to `docker-compose.yml`, ensure the monolithic Dockerfile/entrypoint handles it too.

## Health Check

Run `aoa health` to verify services are running.
